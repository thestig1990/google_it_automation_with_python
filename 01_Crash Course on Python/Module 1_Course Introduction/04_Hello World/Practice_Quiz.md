# Practice Quiz: Hello World

*Congratulations! You passed! Grade received 100%*

### Question 1

1. What are functions in Python?

> - [ ] Functions let us use Python as a calculator.
> - [x] **Functions are pieces of code that perform a unit of work.**
> - [ ] Functions are only used to print messages to the screen.
> - [ ] Functions are how we tell if our program is functioning or not.

*Right on! Python functions encapsulate a certain action, like outputting a message to the screen in the case of print().*

### Question 2

2. What are keywords in Python?

> - [x] **Keywords are reserved words that are used to construct instructions.**
> - [ ] Keywords are used to calculate mathematical operations.
> - [ ] Keywords are used to print messages like "Hello World!" to the screen.
> - [ ] Keywords are the words that we need to memorize to program in Python.

*Using the reserved words provided by the language we can construct complex instructions that will make our scripts*

### Question 3

3. What does the print function do in Python?

> - [ ] The print function generates PDFs and sends it to the nearest printer.*
> - [ ] The print function stores values provided by the user.
> - [ ] **The print function outputs messages to the screen**
> - [ ] The print function calculates mathematical operations.

*You nailed it! Using the print() we can generate output for the user of our programs.*

### Question 4

4. Output a message that says "Programming in Python is fun!" to the screen.

```Python
print("Programming in Python is fun!")
```

*Great work! We're just starting but programming in Python can indeed be a lot of fun.*

### Question 5

5. Replace the ___ placeholder and calculate the Golden ratio: (1 + sqrt(5))/2

```Python
ratio = (1 + 5**(1/2)) / 2
print(ratio)
```

*Awesome job! See how we can use Python to calculate complex values for us.*
