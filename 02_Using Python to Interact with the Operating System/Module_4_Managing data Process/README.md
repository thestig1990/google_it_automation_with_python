# Managing Data and Processes

In this module, we’ll learn about reading and writing to data files based on an interaction with the user.\
Along the way, we’ll dive into standard streams, environment variables, and command line arguments. Next,\
we’ll jump into Python subprocesses, including system commands and how they can be used. We’ll review how\
to obtain output from a system command, and dive into subprocess management, including how to check exit values\
and manipulate the normal versus error exit values. Finally, we’ll rundown processing log files, and will cover\
what a log file is, how to filter log files using regular expressions, and how to understand the output captured\
from log files.

## Learning Objectives

- Interact with log files using regular expressions
- Utilize Python to interact with a user to attain certain values
- Use the input() module to interact with the user
- Describe how subprocess.run works and interacts with system commands like ping
- Explain what a log file is
- Use the get command to pull data from log files
