# Working with Remotes

In this module, you’ll be introduced to GitHub and learn how it works with Git. You’ll create new repositories and\
clone those repositories onto your computer. Next, we’ll explain what a remote repository is, how we can work with\
them, and how we can host them. You’ll get familiar with commands like modify, stage, and commit, which will be used\
for local changes, as well as the fetch command, which can pull any changes from remote repositories. Our final\
lesson will focus on learning about conflicts. This will allow you to explore the concepts of pull-merge-push\
workflows, pushing remote branches and rebasing your changes.
